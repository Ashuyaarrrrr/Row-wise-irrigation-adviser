# Row-Wise AI Irrigation & Fertilizer Advisory System

**Informed water and nutrient decisions for every greenhouse row**

An AI-augmented web application aimed at facilitating **simultaneous multi-crop and staggered greenhouse cultivation** by offering row-wise irrigation duration and fertilizer suggestions depending on crop growth stage and soil type.

---

## Project Description

In conventional greenhouse cultivation, **uniform irrigation and fertilizer schedules** are followed for all greenhouse rows even if crops are of different varieties or growth stages. This practice results in:

- Water misallocation
- Over/under fertilization
- Unbalanced crop growth
- Increased crop disease susceptibility
- Lower farmer revenue

This project proposes a **row-wise advisory system** where each greenhouse row is treated separately and accurate, growth-stage-specific suggestions are provided.

## Main Features

- Row-wise decision support for every greenhouse row
- Automated crop growth stage identification through planting dates
- Soil moisture-driven irrigation suggestions
- Growth stage-specific fertilizer recommendations
- User-friendly and intuitive dashboard design
- Dataset-informed decision-making
- Prepared for seamless hardware sensor integration in the future

## System Functionality

1. Farmer accesses the system and enters greenhouse information.
2. Farmer provides crop type, planting dates, and soil moisture levels.
3. System determines crop age and automatically identifies growth stage.
4. Data is analyzed through rule-based and dataset-driven decision-making.
5. Dashboard shows irrigation duration, fertilizer type, and recommendations.
